# AMPhysio
This project is a Platform for monitoring physiological parameters (heartbeat, temperature ...).
It allows you to connect to the firebase server and retrieve the data saved in the realtime database.
these data were collected by an electronic system distined to the measurement of physiological parameters by sensors
distinguished in the field of physiology.
Firebase is therefore the intermediary between the electronic system and the supervision platform. This allows me to benefit from
real-time firebase services and reduce coding (NoSQL).

<h1><u>Interfaces : </u></h1>

# Login Screen (doctor and patient)
these interfaces are the first thing you see when running this application, so you must authenticate with a password and an email address to access to your personal space as a doctor or a patient.

# List of patients
as you can see here!, this interface represents a list of patients who communicate their test results in real time with the doctor.

# Chat Screen (Doc and Patient)
an exchange of messages between the doctor and the patient is possible in real time.

This project needs some improvements, otherwise, the subject is very interesting nowadays because it can save lives, and also solve a lot of problems and simplify a lot of things such as reducing displacements, real-time supervision and without any human intervention, to preserve human lives... etc
